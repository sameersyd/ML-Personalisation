That is why I left my corporate 9-5 as a fashion designer to start my own business, while being able to freelance design, run my online store, create content, and manage social media for female entrepreneurs looking to grow their brand.\n\nI live to style my customers and my home because it‚Äôs what lights my soul on fire. I also enjoy creating content and making my visions come to life through styling and photography.\n\nLife is too short to stick to one job for the rest of your life. The time to do what you love is NOW and that is why we are all gathered here to uplift and empower one another.\n\nI am super excited to be apart of this growing community and look forward to collaborating and connecting with you all!\n\nwww.blushelegance.com\n\nXoxo,\nThida ","9","9","0","2020-03-03T12:49:31.545Z","2020-03-03T12:49:31.545Z"

Women, just like you, who are experts in their industries, but secretly hiding right in plain sight... behind their stories.\n\nI‚Äôve experienced firsthand the power that storytelling can have on your brand, and it is life-changing!\n\nDid I tell you I became a best-selling author, just mere hours after my co-authored book debuted #1 on Amazon‚Äôs Best Seller List?\n\nHow?\n\nThe power of storytelling!\n\nHere‚Äôs what I want you to know about you and I - \nI am not a unicorn, and these same results and more are possible for YOU too!\n\nüéØ If you‚Äôre ready to claim your position is the spotlight as an influential industry leader\n\nüéØ Show up confidently and consistently in your business, both online and off\n\nüéØ Get paid exceptionally well, and consistently for your story and expertise\n\nThen there‚Äôs one thing you must DO first - DECIDE!!!\n\nThat‚Äôs right girlfriend, every great thing starts with a decision that you deserve more and will do what‚Äôs necessary to have more.\n\nLet me know if you want to chat about how to step into a new, more powerful level of leadership without sacrificing your authenticity. ü•∞\n","9","3","0","2020-03-03T12:49:31.577Z","2020-03-03T12:49:31.577Z"

Totally goofy, I know (especially not something you would expect of a boring dentist haha) but it reminded me of just how important your mindset is to setting yourself up for success every.single.day. \nHow we talk to ourselves is such an overlooked source of inspiration, one that we can all try to capture on a daily basis just by actively investing in positive internal dialogue and affirmations. Kind of along the lines of ‚Äúfake it till you make it‚Äù but taking it to the next level of embodying who and what we are aiming to be from the inside out. Females especially (not to discount males who also feel this way) with the pressures and comparisons that come with visual media tend to have a less than positive internal dialogue which can hold us back from empowering ourselves to get out there and dive in head first into our goals. \nLet‚Äôs flip the script with injecting positivity, confidence and belief in ourselves so that we can not only make ourselves stronger, and more focused on our own personal mountains but also to share that with others around us to help every #femtrepreneur be the best she can be‚Äî everyday. ü¶ã\n\n#bewhoyouhopetobe #mirrortalk #inspireinside ","14","2","0","2020-03-03T12:49:31.745Z","2020-03-03T12:49:31.745Z"

We at times may take on more work then what we can handle. So learn to say no if possible for some extra work that may take away your enjoyment, time and stress.  Or don‚Äôt commit to deadlines that you know are physically and mentally not possible, it will give you time to complete and relieve that stress you may have.\n\nAvoid negative people and make positive friends.  Maybe you are being influenced for the worst and someone else‚Äôs thoughts are consuming your mind.  We want to think freely but we want to build good energy, so consider leaving the area your currently working in and venture out to other departments and locations at work and talk to others, they may feed you a different (but definitely refreshing) energy that may get you in a brighter spirit.\n\nAt least your on a job hunt process though right? That‚Äôs always a happy side to everything!l\nIf you truly are unhappy, to where the little things don't make much of a difference, then it truly is time to smile because the thought of growing and developing elsewhere should get you excited!\n\nWhat is currently stressing you out?","8","10","0","2020-03-03T12:49:31.776Z","2020-03-03T12:49:31.776Z"

Plan. Have you planned your podcast to the last detail? Do you have a clear podcast ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. Can you identify the person your podcast is supposed to reach? Who is your podcast for? \n2. Time. Don‚Äôt underestimate in the beginning how long it will take. No just recording straight into your app isn‚Äôt the answer. üòè howling does it take to do each piece? I‚Äôve built a business out of the part ppl find the most time consuming- podcast editing. \n3. Schedule it. What will you do when? When will you record? When will you edit, do your scheduling? When will you plan social media and promotion and execute it. \n4. Batch record. If at all possible this  is a life saver. Have your episodes ready to go.\n5. Be patient with yourself. There‚Äôs a learning curve for everyone. I‚Äôm a better editor than I was last year. You will get better at recording, interviewing and creating content.

I recently started making animated text videos & moving pictures for a few clients like the ones I'm attaching and really enjoying it. Definitely a nice change of pace from routine graphic design and social media management like I'm normally doing. I love my job, but sometimes change is nice!\n\nI wanted to see if anyone was interested in either of these for their business, personal brand, or really anything. They're both great for ad campaigns and even just to liven up a social feed. \n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Animated text video: These can fit YOUR brand! Color and font options are as extensive as we want to get. One of my primary services is brand implementation and management so I'm all about sticking true to that.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Moving Images: Totally customizable as well. These definitely have a specific feel to them, but that's because they were for a specific client. Type of image and layout of movement is totally up to you! (Just no images we don't have rights to. üòâ)\n\nThis would be a flat fee (I'm talking LOW) with up to 3 edits. This really isn't for the purpose of making money, but rather to give those the opportunity for some new design work and connect with more of you amazing people! Let's talk ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è","1","12","0","2020-03-03T12:49:31.814Z","2020-03-03T12:49:31.814Z"
